### ❓ Question 1: What is the difference between Spark Context and Spark Session?
#### Answer:

**Spark Context:**
- Entry point for Spark Core functionality
- Creates RDDs, accumulators, and broadcast variables
- Coordinates with cluster manager
- One SparkContext per JVM
- Lower-level API

**Spark Session:**
- Unified entry point for Spark 2.0+
- Encapsulates SparkContext, SQLContext, and HiveContext
- Provides DataFrame/Dataset API
- Supports SQL queries
- Higher-level abstraction

**Key Differences:**
- SparkSession is the modern, recommended approach
- SparkContext is more low-level and primarily for RDD operations
- SparkSession provides better integration with structured APIs

**Code Example:**
```scala
// Spark Context (older approach)
val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName("MyApp")
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)

// Spark Session (modern approach)
val spark = SparkSession.builder()
  .appName("MyApp")
  .getOrCreate()
```

### ❓ Question 3: Explain Scala Traits and Closures with examples.
#### Answer:

**Traits:**
- Similar to interfaces but can contain concrete methods
- Support multiple inheritance
- Can have fields and constructors
- Used for mixins

```scala
trait Printable {
  def print(): Unit = println("Printing...")
}

trait Drawable {
  def draw(): Unit
}

class Document extends Printable with Drawable {
  def draw(): Unit = println("Drawing document")
}
```

**Closures:**
- Functions that capture variables from their enclosing scope
- Variables are "closed over" by the function
- Can access and modify variables from outer scope

```scala
def multiplier(factor: Int) = (x: Int) => x * factor

val double = multiplier(2)  // Closure captures 'factor'
val triple = multiplier(3)

println(double(5))  // Output: 10
println(triple(5))  // Output: 15
```

### ❓ Question 4: Explain Python Decorators and Generators with examples.
#### Answer:

**Decorators:**
- Functions that modify or extend other functions
- Use `@` syntax
- Common for logging, timing, authentication

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}")
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Finished {func.__name__}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Usage
greet("Alice")  # Prints decorator messages + greeting
```

**Generators:**
- Functions that yield values one at a time
- Memory efficient for large datasets
- Use `yield` keyword
- Return generator objects

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Usage
for num in fibonacci(10):
    print(num)

# Generator expression
squares = (x**2 for x in range(10))
```

### ❓ Question 9: Write code to find the top 3 highest-paid employees in each department.
#### Answer:

**SQL Solution:**
```sql
WITH ranked_employees AS (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        employee_name,
        department,
        salary,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM employees
)
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    employee_name,
    department,
    salary
FROM ranked_employees
WHERE rn <= 3
ORDER BY department, salary DESC;
```

**PySpark Solution:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import row_number, desc

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("TopEmployees").getOrCreate()

# Assuming we have a DataFrame 'employees'
# employees = spark.read.table("employees")

# Define window specification
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy(desc("salary"))

# Apply window function
result = employees.withColumn("rn", row_number().over(window_spec)) \
                 .filter("rn <= 3") \
                 .select("employee_id", "employee_name", "department", "salary") \
                 .orderBy("department", desc("salary"))

result.show()
```

**Alternative PySpark with DataFrame API:**
```python
# Using DataFrame operations
result = employees.groupBy("department") \
                 .apply(lambda x: x.orderBy(desc("salary")).limit(3)) \
                 .select("employee_id", "employee_name", "department", "salary")
```

### ❓ Question 10: Explain memory management in Spark.
#### Answer:

**Spark Memory Model:**

1. **Execution Memory:**
   - Used for computations (joins, aggregations, sorting)
   - Temporary storage during task execution
   - Can spill to disk if insufficient

2. **Storage Memory:**
   - Used for caching RDDs/DataFrames
   - Broadcast variables
   - Can be evicted using LRU policy

3. **User Memory:**
   - User data structures
   - UDFs and user code
   - Spark metadata

**Memory Allocation:**
- **Total Memory = Executor Memory - Reserved Memory**
- **Unified Memory = Total Memory × 0.6** (configurable)
- **Execution Memory = Unified Memory × 0.5** (initially)
- **Storage Memory = Unified Memory × 0.5** (initially)

**Key Configurations:**
```scala
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "4g")
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memoryFraction", "0.6")
spark.conf.set("spark.storage.memoryFraction", "0.5")
spark.conf.set("spark.storage.storageFraction", "0.5")
```

**Memory Management Strategies:**
1. **Appropriate partitioning**
2. **Efficient serialization** (Kryo vs Java)
3. **Proper caching levels** (MEMORY_ONLY, MEMORY_AND_DISK, etc.)
4. **Avoiding data skew**
5. **Garbage collection tuning**
6. **Broadcasting small datasets**

**Memory Issues & Solutions:**
- **OOM Errors:** Increase executor memory, reduce partition size
- **Spilling:** Optimize joins, increase shuffle partitions
- **GC Pressure:** Tune GC settings, reduce object creation

| Structure | Simple, flat | Complex, hierarchical |
| Joins | Fewer joins | More joins |
| Query Performance | Faster | Slower |
| Storage | Higher | Lower |
| Maintenance | Easier | More complex |
| Data Redundancy | Higher | Lower |

**Example:**
```sql
-- Star Schema
FACT_SALES (sale_id, product_id, customer_id, date_id, amount)
DIM_PRODUCT (product_id, product_name, category, brand, price)
DIM_CUSTOMER (customer_id, customer_name, city, state, country)

-- Snowflake Schema
FACT_SALES (sale_id, product_id, customer_id, date_id, amount)
DIM_PRODUCT (product_id, product_name, category_id, brand_id, price)
DIM_CATEGORY (category_id, category_name)
DIM_BRAND (brand_id, brand_name)
DIM_CUSTOMER (customer_id, customer_name, city_id)

### ❓ Question 13: Given five zeroes (0 0 0 0 0), use any mathematical operators to make it equal to 120.

**Answer:**

**Solutions:**

**Solution 1: Using Factorial**
```
(0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)! = 120
```
Explanation: 0! = 1, so (1+1+1+1+1)! = 5! = 120

**Solution 2: Using Powers and Factorials**
```
((0! + 0!)^(0! + 0! + 0!))! = 120
```
Explanation: (2^3)! = 8! = 40,320... wait, this is wrong.

**Correct Solution 2:**
```
(0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)! = 5! = 120
```

**Solution 3: Using Ceiling/Floor Functions**
```
⌈0.0! + 0.0! + 0.0! + 0.0! + 0.0!⌉! × (0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)!
```

**Most Common Answer:**
```
(0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0!)! = 5! = 120
```

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. 0! = 1 (by definition)
2. 0! + 0! + 0! + 0! + 0! = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
3. 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120

### ❓ Question 14: Explain the difference between Transformations and Actions in Spark.

**Answer:**

**Transformations:**
- Lazy operations that create new RDDs
- Not executed immediately
- Build up a lineage graph (DAG)
- Return RDD/DataFrame/Dataset

**Actions:**
- Eager operations that trigger computation
- Execute immediately
- Return values to driver program
- Trigger the execution of transformation chain

**Transformation Examples:**
```scala
// Narrow Transformations (no shuffle)
val rdd1 = sc.parallelize(1 to 10)
val rdd2 = rdd1.map(_ * 2)          // map
val rdd3 = rdd1.filter(_ > 5)       // filter
val rdd4 = rdd1.flatMap(x => List(x, x * 2))  // flatMap

// Wide Transformations (require shuffle)
val rdd5 = rdd1.groupBy(_ % 2)      // groupBy
val rdd6 = rdd1.distinct()          // distinct
val rdd7 = rdd1.sortBy(x => x)      // sortBy
val rdd8 = rdd1.reduceByKey(_ + _)  // reduceByKey
```

**Action Examples:**
```scala
// Actions that return values
val count = rdd1.count()            // count
val firstElement = rdd1.first()     // first
val allElements = rdd1.collect()    // collect
val sum = rdd1.reduce(_ + _)        // reduce
val taken = rdd1.take(5)           // take

// Actions that save data
rdd1.saveAsTextFile("path")         // saveAsTextFile
rdd1.foreach(println)               // foreach
```

**DataFrame/Dataset Examples:**
```scala
// Transformations
val df1 = df.select("name", "age")
val df2 = df.filter($"age" > 18)
val df3 = df.groupBy("department").count()
val df4 = df.orderBy($"salary".desc)

// Actions
df.show()                           // show
df.count()                          // count
df.collect()                        // collect
df.write.parquet("path")           // write
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Execution:** Transformations are lazy, Actions are eager
- **Return Type:** Transformations return RDD/DataFrame, Actions return values
- **Performance:** Transformations are optimized together, Actions trigger execution
- **Caching:** Only makes sense with transformations

### ❓ Question 15: Explain common searching and sorting algorithms with their complexities.

**Answer:**

**Searching Algorithms:**

**1. Linear Search:**
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
```

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return -1

# Time: O(log n), Space: O(1)
# Requires sorted array
```

**Sorting Algorithms:**

        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key

# Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)
# Best case: O(n) for nearly sorted arrays
```

**4. Merge Sort:**
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

# Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)
```

**5. Quick Sort:**
```python
def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(arr, low, high)
        quick_sort(arr, low, pi - 1)
        quick_sort(arr, pi + 1, high)

def partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1
    
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    
    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1

# Average: O(n log n), Worst: O(n²), Space: O(log n)
```

### ❓ Question 16: Explain the difference between DENSE_RANK and RANK functions.

**Answer:**

**RANK Function:**
- Assigns ranks with gaps
- Same values get same rank
- Next rank skips numbers based on count of ties

**DENSE_RANK Function:**
- Assigns ranks without gaps
- Same values get same rank
- Next rank is always consecutive

**Example Data:**
```sql
-- Sample table: employees
| name    | salary |
|---------|--------|
| Alice   | 5000   |
| Bob     | 4000   |
| Charlie | 5000   |
| David   | 3000   |
| Eve     | 4000   |
```

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank_num,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as dense_rank_num,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as row_num
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

**Results:**
```
| name    | salary | rank_num | dense_rank_num | row_num |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|---------|
| Alice   | 5000   | 1        | 1              | 1       |
| Charlie | 5000   | 1        | 1              | 2       |
| Bob     | 4000   | 3        | 2              | 3       |
| Eve     | 4000   | 3        | 2              | 4       |
| David   | 3000   | 5        | 3              | 5       |
```

**Key Differences:**
- **RANK:** 1, 1, 3, 3, 5 (gaps exist)
- **DENSE_RANK:** 1, 1, 2, 2, 3 (no gaps)
- **ROW_NUMBER:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (unique numbers)

**PySpark Implementation:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import rank, dense_rank, row_number, desc

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("RankDemo").getOrCreate()

# Create sample data
data = [("Alice", 5000), ("Bob", 4000), ("Charlie", 5000), 
        ("David", 3000), ("Eve", 4000)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["name", "salary"])

# Define window specification
window_spec = Window.orderBy(desc("salary"))

# Apply ranking functions
result = df.withColumn("rank", rank().over(window_spec)) \
          .withColumn("dense_rank", dense_rank().over(window_spec)) \
          .withColumn("row_number", row_number().over(window_spec))

result.show()
```

**Use Cases:**
- **RANK:** Tournament standings, academic rankings
- **DENSE_RANK:** Grade assignments, performance tiers
- **ROW_NUMBER:** Creating unique identifiers, pagination

    FROM sequence_table
) t
WHERE next_id - id > 1;
```

---

### ❓ Question 18: Explain common DataFrame operations like groupby, first, max with examples.

**Answer:**

**PySpark DataFrame Operations:**

**1. GroupBy Operations:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DataFrameOps").getOrCreate()

# Sample data
data = [("Alice", "Sales", 5000), ("Bob", "IT", 6000), 
        ("Charlie", "Sales", 4500), ("David", "IT", 5500)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["name", "department", "salary"])

# Basic groupBy
dept_stats = df.groupBy("department").agg(
    avg("salary").alias("avg_salary"),
    max("salary").alias("max_salary"),
    min("salary").alias("min_salary"),
    count("*").alias("employee_count")
)

# Multiple groupBy columns
df.groupBy("department", "salary").count().show()
```

**2. First() Function:**
```python
# Get first row
first_row = df.first()
print(first_row)

# Get first value in each group
first_in_group = df.groupBy("department").agg(
    first("name").alias("first_employee"),
    first("salary").alias("first_salary")
)

# First with ordering
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

window_spec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy("salary")
df.withColumn("first_in_dept", 
              first("name").over(window_spec)).show()
```

**3. Max() Function:**
```python
# Global max
max_salary = df.agg(max("salary")).collect()[0][0]

# Max by group
max_by_dept = df.groupBy("department").agg(max("salary").alias("max_salary"))

# Row with max value
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy(desc("salary"))

df.withColumn("rank", rank().over(window_spec)) \
  .filter(col("rank") == 1) \
  .drop("rank") \
  .show()
```

**4. Advanced DataFrame Operations:**
```python
# Pivot operations
pivot_df = df.groupBy("department").pivot("name").sum("salary")

# Window functions
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy("salary")
df.withColumn("running_total", sum("salary").over(window_spec)) \
  .withColumn("lag_salary", lag("salary").over(window_spec)) \
  .withColumn("lead_salary", lead("salary").over(window_spec)) \
  .show()

# Multiple aggregations
multi_agg = df.groupBy("department").agg(
    count("*").alias("count"),
    sum("salary").alias("total_salary"),
    avg("salary").alias("avg_salary"),
    stddev("salary").alias("stddev_salary")
)
```

**5. Complex GroupBy with Custom Functions:**
```python
from pyspark.sql.types import *

# Custom aggregation function
def salary_range(salaries):
    return max(salaries) - min(salaries)

# Register UDF
salary_range_udf = udf(salary_range, IntegerType())

# Apply custom aggregation
df.groupBy("department").agg(
    collect_list("salary").alias("all_salaries")
).withColumn("salary_range", 
             salary_range_udf(col("all_salaries"))) \
 .drop("all_salaries") \
 .show()
```

**6. DataFrame Joins and Transformations:**
```python
# Join operations
dept_info = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("Sales", "Building A"), ("IT", "Building B")
], ["department", "location"])

joined_df = df.join(dept_info, "department", "inner")

# Column operations
df.select("name", "salary", 
          (col("salary") * 1.1).alias("new_salary")) \
  .withColumn("salary_category", 
              when(col("salary") > 5000, "High")
              .when(col("salary") > 4000, "Medium")
              .otherwise("Low")) \
  .show()
```

**Common Patterns:**
- **GroupBy + Agg:** Statistical operations per group
- **Window Functions:** Ranking, running totals, lag/lead
- **Pivot:** Transform rows to columns
- **Join:** Combine multiple DataFrames
- **Filter + Select:** Data subset operations

---

### ❓ Question 19: Explain logical and physical plans in Spark query execution.

**Answer:**

**Spark Query Execution Process:**

1. **SQL/DataFrame API** → **Logical Plan** → **Physical Plan** → **Execution**

**Logical Plan:**
- Abstract representation of computation
- Describes WHAT needs to be done
- Independent of execution strategy
- Created by Catalyst optimizer

**Physical Plan:**
- Concrete execution strategy
- Describes HOW computation will be executed
- Includes specific operators and algorithms
- Considers available resources

**Example:**
```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

val spark = SparkSession.builder().appName("PlanExample").getOrCreate()

// Create sample DataFrames
val employees = spark.read.parquet("employees.parquet")
val departments = spark.read.parquet("departments.parquet")

// Query
val result = employees
  .filter($"salary" > 5000)
  .join(departments, "dept_id")
  .select($"name", $"salary", $"dept_name")
  .orderBy($"salary".desc)
```

**View Plans:**
```scala
// Logical plan
result.explain(true)

// Or more detailed
result.queryExecution.logical
result.queryExecution.optimizedPlan
result.queryExecution.executedPlan
```

**Logical Plan Stages:**

1. **Parsed Logical Plan:**
```
Sort [salary DESC]
+- Project [name, salary, dept_name]
   +- Join [dept_id]
      :- Filter (salary > 5000)
      :  +- Relation employees
      +- Relation departments
```

2. **Analyzed Logical Plan:**
- Resolves column references
- Checks data types
- Validates table existence

3. **Optimized Logical Plan:**
- Catalyst optimizer applies rules
- Predicate pushdown
- Projection pruning
- Constant folding

```
Sort [salary DESC]
+- Project [name, salary, dept_name]
   +- Join [dept_id]
      :- Project [name, salary, dept_id]
      :  +- Filter (salary > 5000)
      :     +- Relation employees
      +- Relation departments
```

**Physical Plan:**
```
*(3) Sort [salary DESC]
+- Exchange rangepartitioning(salary DESC)
   +- *(2) Project [name, salary, dept_name]
      +- *(2) BroadcastHashJoin [dept_id]
         :- *(2) Project [name, salary, dept_id]
         :  +- *(2) Filter (salary > 5000)
         :     +- *(2) FileScan parquet employees
         +- BroadcastExchange
            +- *(1) FileScan parquet departments
```

**Key Physical Operators:**
- **FileScan:** Read from storage
- **Filter:** Apply predicates
- **Project:** Select columns
- **BroadcastHashJoin:** Join with broadcast
- **Sort:** Sort data
- **Exchange:** Shuffle data between partitions

**Catalyst Optimizer Rules:**
```scala
// Common optimizations
1. Predicate Pushdown: Move filters closer to data source
2. Projection Pruning: Read only required columns
3. Constant Folding: Evaluate constants at compile time
4. Join Reordering: Optimize join order
5. Broadcast Join: Use broadcast for small tables
```

**Code Analysis:**
```scala
// Enable extended explain
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled", "true")

// Analyze query execution
val df = spark.sql("""
    SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.dept_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
    WHERE e.salary > 5000
    ORDER BY e.salary DESC
""")

// Show all plans
df.explain("extended")
```

**Performance Implications:**
- **Logical Plan:** Determines optimization opportunities
- **Physical Plan:** Affects actual execution performance
- **Catalyst Optimizer:** Automatically improves query performance
- **Adaptive Query Execution:** Runtime optimizations based on statistics

### ❓ Question 20: Explain Entity-Relationship (E-R) models in SQL with examples.

**Answer:**

**Entity-Relationship Model Components:**

**1. Entities:**
- Real-world objects or concepts
- Represented as tables in database
- Have attributes (columns)

**2. Attributes:**
- Properties of entities
- Columns in tables
- Types: Simple, Composite, Derived, Multi-valued

**3. Relationships:**
- Associations between entities
- Types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many

**4. Keys:**
- **Primary Key:** Unique identifier
- **Foreign Key:** Reference to another table
- **Composite Key:** Multiple columns as key

**E-R Diagram Example: University System**

**Entities:**
- Student (StudentID, Name, Email, DOB)
- Course (CourseID, CourseName, Credits)
- Professor (ProfessorID, Name, Department)
- Enrollment (StudentID, CourseID, Grade, Semester)

**Relationships:**
- Student enrolls in Course (Many-to-Many)
- Professor teaches Course (One-to-Many)
- Student has Enrollment (One-to-Many)

**SQL Implementation:**
```sql
-- Entity Tables
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    DOB DATE,
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Professor (
    ProfessorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    HireDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Credits INT,
    ProfessorID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProfessorID) REFERENCES Professor(ProfessorID)
);

-- Relationship Table (Many-to-Many)
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    Grade CHAR(2),
    Semester VARCHAR(20),
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID, Semester),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
);
```

**Cardinality Examples:**

**1. One-to-One (1:1):**
```sql
-- Person has one Passport
CREATE TABLE Person (
    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Passport (
    PassportID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PassportNumber VARCHAR(20),
    PersonID INT UNIQUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Person(PersonID)
);
```

**2. One-to-Many (1:N):**
```sql
-- Department has many Employees
CREATE TABLE Department (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Department(DeptID)
);
```

**3. Many-to-Many (M:N):**
```sql
-- Authors write Books (resolved with junction table)
CREATE TABLE Author (
    AuthorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Book (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(200)
);

CREATE TABLE BookAuthor (
    AuthorID INT,
    BookID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (AuthorID, BookID),
    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Author(AuthorID),
    FOREIGN KEY (BookID) REFERENCES Book(BookID)
);
```

**Advanced E-R Concepts:**

**1. Weak Entity:**
```sql
-- Dependent entity that depends on strong entity
CREATE TABLE Order (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE
);

CREATE TABLE OrderItem (
    OrderID INT,
    ItemNumber INT,
```
---

### ❓ Question 21. Groupby and Having

**GROUP BY** is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. **HAVING** is used to filter groups created by GROUP BY based on aggregate conditions.

**Key Differences:**
- WHERE filters rows before grouping
- HAVING filters groups after grouping
- HAVING can use aggregate functions, WHERE cannot

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as emp_count, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 30000
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

## 22. End to End Pipeline of the Project

**Typical Data Engineering Pipeline:**

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Batch: HDFS, S3, databases
   - Streaming: Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub

2. **Data Processing**
   - Raw data cleaning and validation
   - Transformations using Spark
   - Data quality checks

3. **Data Storage**
   - Data Lake: Parquet, Delta Lake
   - Data Warehouse: Hive, Redshift, BigQuery

4. **Data Serving**
   - APIs, dashboards, reports
   - ML model serving

5. **Monitoring & Orchestration**
   - Airflow, Prefect for scheduling
   - Logging, alerting, and monitoring

## 23. Optimization in Spark

**Performance Optimization Techniques:**

1. **Caching & Persistence**
   ```python
   df.cache()  # or df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
   ```

2. **Partitioning**
   - Use appropriate partition columns
   - Avoid small files problem
   - Use repartition() or coalesce()

3. **Broadcast Variables**
   ```python
   broadcast_var = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(small_dict)
   ```

4. **Avoid Shuffling**
   - Use broadcast joins for small tables
   - Partition data appropriately
   - Use bucketing

5. **Serialization**
   - Use Kryo serialization
   - Avoid UDFs when possible

6. **Memory Management**
   - Tune executor memory
   - Use appropriate storage levels

## 24. Transformations & Actions

**Transformations (Lazy Evaluation):**
- Return new RDD/DataFrame
- Not executed until action is called
- Examples: map(), filter(), select(), groupBy(), join()

**Actions (Eager Evaluation):**
- Trigger computation and return results
- Examples: collect(), count(), show(), save(), take()

**Example:**
```python
# Transformations (lazy)
df_filtered = df.filter(df.age > 18)
df_selected = df_filtered.select("name", "age")

# Action (triggers execution)
df_selected.show()
```

## 25. Spark Architecture and DAG Formation

**Spark Architecture:**

1. **Driver Program**
   - Contains SparkContext
   - Coordinates execution
   - Maintains cluster state

2. **Cluster Manager**
   - YARN, Mesos, Kubernetes, Standalone
   - Resource allocation

3. **Executors**
   - Run tasks
   - Store data for caching
   - Report status to driver

**DAG Formation:**
- Spark builds Directed Acyclic Graph of operations
- Transformations create DAG nodes
- Actions trigger DAG execution
- Catalyst optimizer optimizes logical plan
- Code generation creates physical plan

## 26. How to Decide Number of Executors and Cores

**Guidelines:**

1. **Cores per Executor:**
   - Recommended: 4-5 cores per executor
   - Avoid > 5 cores (diminishing returns)

2. **Memory per Executor:**
   - Leave 1GB for OS overhead
   - Formula: (Total RAM - 1GB) / Number of executors

3. **Number of Executors:**
   - Formula: (Total cores / cores per executor) - 1 (for driver)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Cluster: 10 nodes, 16 cores each, 64GB RAM each
- Total cores: 160
- Cores per executor: 5
- Executors per node: 16/5 = 3
- Total executors: 10 * 3 = 30
- Executor memory: (64-1)/3 = ~21GB
```

## 27. Difference Between Window Functions and Group By

**GROUP BY:**
- Reduces number of rows
- Aggregates data into groups
- Cannot access individual row data after grouping

**Window Functions:**
- Maintains original row count
- Performs calculations across related rows
- Can access both aggregate and individual row data

**Example:**
```sql
-- GROUP BY (reduces rows)
SELECT department, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Window Function (maintains rows)
SELECT name, salary, department,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_avg
FROM employees;
```

## 28. Broadcast Variables

**Purpose:**
- Distribute read-only data to all executors
- Avoid sending large variables with each task
- Improve performance for joins with small tables

**Usage:**
```python
# Create broadcast variable
broadcast_dict = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(small_lookup_dict)

# Use in transformations
def lookup_function(value):
    return broadcast_dict.value.get(value, "Unknown")

df.withColumn("category", lookup_function(df.code))
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces network traffic
- Faster joins with small datasets
- Cached on each executor

## 29. List and Tuple in Python

**List:**
- Mutable (can be modified)
- Ordered collection
- Syntax: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Methods: append(), remove(), pop(), etc.

**Tuple:**
- Immutable (cannot be modified)
- Ordered collection
- Syntax: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Methods: count(), index()

**Key Differences:**
```python
# List - mutable
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Works
my_list[0] = 10    # Works

# Tuple - immutable
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple.append(4)  # Error!
# my_tuple[0] = 10    # Error!
```

**Use Cases:**
- List: When you need to modify data
- Tuple: When you need fixed data (coordinates, database records)

## 30. Get Monthly Average of Balance Amount

**Using DataFrame API:**
```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Sample data
df = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("2023-01-15", 1000.0),
    ("2023-01-20", 1500.0),
    ("2023-02-10", 2000.0),
    ("2023-02-25", 1800.0)
], ["date", "balance"])

# Convert date string to date type and extract year-month
result = df.withColumn("date", F.to_date(F.col("date"), "yyyy-MM-dd")) \
          .withColumn("year_month", F.date_format(F.col("date"), "yyyy-MM")) \
          .groupBy("year_month") \
          .agg(F.avg("balance").alias("monthly_avg_balance")) \
          .orderBy("year_month")

result.show()
```

**Using Spark SQL:**
```python
# Register DataFrame as temp view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("transactions")

# SQL query
monthly_avg = spark.sql("""
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(TO_DATE(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd'), 'yyyy-MM') as year_month,
        AVG(balance) as monthly_avg_balance
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(TO_DATE(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd'), 'yyyy-MM')
    ORDER BY year_month
""")

monthly_avg.show()
```

**Alternative using substring:**
```python
# Using substring for year-month extraction
result = df.withColumn("year_month", F.substring("date", 1, 7)) \
          .groupBy("year_month") \
          .agg(F.avg("balance").alias("monthly_avg_balance")) \
          .orderBy("year_month")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
+----------+-------------------+
|year_month|monthly_avg_balance|
+----------+-------------------+
|   2023-01|             1250.0|
|   2023-02|             1900.0|
+----------+-------------------+
```
